            <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Liliana Chau and I am a Senior at Citrus Valley High School.
            I am currently taking 5 Advanced Placement classes that mainly revolve around the STEM area of learning. Although I enjoy my core classes, my favorite class is AP Computer Science <i>(hence, why this website was created)</i>.
            I am currently ranked in the top 50 of my graduating class and hope to pursue Computer Science Engineering in college.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>However</b>, you're probably wondering who I am as a person beyond my academic status. 
            <i>This is the purpose of this website.</i> I encourage you to look through all of the links and, well, get to know me. 
            </p>
