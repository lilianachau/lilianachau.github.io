        <h2>My Mother's Side: Jalisco, Mexico</h2>
        
        <p>My mother grew up in Jalisco Mexico with a large family of eight children. Although her family grew up in poverty, she describes the unbreakable family bond that 
        kept them together through her hardships. Her father worked in a shoemaking factory and her mother stayed at home to watch the children. 
        </p>
        <p>The family moved to California in pursuit of a better life. My mother attended Valley High School
        in Santa Ana and eventually got a full ride to the University of Davis off of a Track Scholarship.</p>
        </br>
        
        <h2>My Father's Side: Vietnam</h2>
        <p>My father was born in Vietnam prior to the Vietnam War. He describes life before the war 
        as simple and pleasant. He recalls memories with his younger siblings where they would run down 
        to the lake to fish. However, this all changed upon the arrival of the war. 
        His family left on a boat cramed with other families in pursuit of a better life. They were stationed in Hong Kong for a year before 
        before arriving in Santa Ana. He attended Valley High School in Santa Ana before recieving a full ride from the University of Berkeley.</p>

        <h2>Woodland, Ca</h2>  
        <p>I was born on a crisp early morning on March 11, 2000 in Woodland California. 
        Woodland is a beautiful town located in Northern California and it often characterized by 
        it's vast amount of trees. My dad was attending University of Berkeley as a Physics Major while my mother 
        was raising my older sister, my older brother, and me. Although Woodland has a special place in my 
        heart, we luckily moved when my dad found an internship at Cisco in Silicon Valley. </p>
        
        </br>
        
        <h2>Highland, Ca</h2>
        <p>My family moved to Highland California the following year in pursuit of starting a new life. 
        My father's internship at Cisco lasted only for a year until he was promoted. Today, he is a head of one of the 
        departments at Cisco Systems and our family lives a happy life in Southern California. </p>
